#Solar System in Java 3D
I created a model of a solar system using Java 3D. It includes all the planets rendered, a rocket which spins around the universe and a UFO which you can move using your mouse.

## Planets
As you can see the sun is rendered with a polish texture, and I have rendered all the planets

## Rocket spinning around universe
As you can see the rocket is moving around the sun

## Collision detection 
To move the UFOs first move your mouse to it, then right click and then move

Once the UFO hits the Sun it turns blue (it contaminates the sun)
